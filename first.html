<h2 id="todo" class="food">THINGS TO DO</h2>

        
<p class="food">One of my favourite things to do is relax. Whether it is with a book in a hotel, or on the beach, I love it. I also like going out and seeing new things. I like to take walks throughout the city to see what the culture and country feels like. I love visiting landmarks and important things!
